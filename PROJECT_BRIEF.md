# Project Brief

## Project Name
(Short, working name of the project)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Describe the problem you want to solve.

- What is currently painful or inefficient?
- Who experiences this problem (you, team, specific role)?
- How is this problem solved today?
- Why is the current solution not good enough?

Keep this section solution-agnostic.
No technology, no features, no UI.

---

## 2. Goal

What does success look like?

- What should be easier after this exists?
- What outcome do you want, not how it is achieved?

The goal should be clear enough that you can say:
“I will know this works when…”

---

## 3. Audience

Who is this for?

- Only you?
- A small internal group?
- Non-technical users?

Be honest. This drives all complexity decisions.

---

## 4. Non-Goals

Explicitly list what this project is NOT trying to do.

Examples:
- Not a full financial management system
- Not a SaaS product
- Not multi-user
- Not mobile-first
- Not highly scalable

This section protects the project from scope creep.

---

## 5. Constraints

Hard rules that must not be violated.

Examples:
- No UI in v0.1
- No external integrations
- Local-only execution
- No real-time updates
- Simple data formats only

If something feels “obvious”, write it anyway.

---

## 6. Conceptual Model (High-Level)

Describe the system at a conceptual level.

- Inputs:
  - What data goes in?
- Processing:
  - What happens to that data (conceptually)?
- Outputs:
  - What information comes out?

No classes, no functions, no frameworks.

---

## 7. Data Model (v0.1)

Describe the minimal data required.

- What entities exist?
- What are the essential fields?
- What changes over time vs what is stable?

This is not a database schema.
It is a thinking tool.

---

## 8. Milestones / Timeline (If Applicable)

List important checkpoints or deadlines the system must reason about.

Examples:
- Dates
- Phases
- Financial milestones
- Review points

Optional, but recommended for planning tools.

---

## 9. Open Questions

Things that are not decided yet.

Examples:
- Should X be configurable later?
- Is Y a fixed rule or user-defined?
- Do we need history or just current state?

This section is expected to shrink over time.

---

## 10. Current Status

Where are we right now?

Examples:
- Idea only
- Planning phase
- Waiting for validation
- Ready for Claude brainstorming
- In implementation

This makes the document usable across sessions.

---

## 11. Notes / Context

Any extra context that helps understanding:
- screenshots
- links
- references
- personal constraints (time, energy, frequency of use)

Optional but useful.
